				I am a second year BSc student of Computer Science at Aberystwyth University.
				As you can see from my attached CV, my marks in software-centred courses are very good 
				– which proves that my knowledge about this subject is at a high level (considering that I’m in the middle of my studies).
				I believe that knowledge and skills built up during the first year make me a perfect candidate for the abovementioned position.
				I know that there is still much to learn in this area, 
				but I am committed to developing myself and making up for my gaps in knowledge through eagerness to study.
				I am a quick learner, so the process should not take too much time.
				Both my university and my diverse workplaces helped me in the development of presentation and communication skills. 
				In addition to being a good team member, I am also more than capable of working on my own. 
				I am confident that I can bring new viewpoint and freshness to the team,
				which could also enhance the overall performance of the company. 
				I believe I can hit the ground running and start my professional career with you.
